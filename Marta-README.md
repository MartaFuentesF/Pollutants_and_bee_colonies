Notes:

* Slight variations, resulting from additional analyses, may occur between reported losses in publications and those shown on this map.
* Responses for beekeepers that manage colonies in more than one state are included in the loss calculation for each state they keep bees in.
* Percent of beekeepers exclusive to the state indicates the percent of responding beekeepers who do NOT keep bees in other states in addition to the state indicated here.
* "Average loss" represents the average level of loss experienced by a beekeeper in its operation in the selected state. "Total loss" is the estimate of the number of colonies lost by the whole beekeeping population in that state.
* For the protection of privacy, losses are reported as N/A if 5 or fewer beekeepers responded in that state. These beekeepers losses are included in the national statistics.
